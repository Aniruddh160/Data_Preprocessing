Project Title: Data Preprocessing for Predictive Modeling

Description:
This project focuses on preparing a dataset for predictive modeling through various data preprocessing techniques. It involves the following steps:

Importing Libraries: Utilize Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation, numerical computations, and machine learning functionalities.

Importing Dataset: Load the dataset into the project environment, typically in a Pandas DataFrame, from a local file or a remote data source.

Splitting Dataset: Divide the dataset into two subsets - the feature set (independent variables) and the target or training set (dependent variable) using techniques like train-test split.

Encoding Categorical Data: Handle categorical data by converting them into numerical equivalents, employing techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding, ensuring compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize the feature set to bring all features to a similar scale, preventing certain features from dominating the model due to their larger magnitudes.

By meticulously performing these data preprocessing steps, the dataset becomes optimized and suitable for training predictive models, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of subsequent machine learning tasks.
